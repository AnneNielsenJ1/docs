# JupiterOne Style Guide

 

## General Guidelines

**Voice**: Use the second person to be more direct and personable. We want our customers to know we are speaking directly to them.

**Tense**: Always use the present tense when speaking about current features. Only use the future tense when referring to some that has not yet released and is coming in the future. 

**Internationalization**: Keep your content in plain English, avoid colloquialisms, and other jargon not recognized outside the US. Remember that not all customers will be native English speakers and we don't want to slow down their comprehension. 

**Contractions and abbreviations**: For plain English reasons, spell out contractions and avoid using abbreviations such as "e.g., etc." Write out all words and phrases - avoid writing as if you are sending an SMS. 



## Formatting

Use bold for all UI controls, such as buttons and tabs.

## Punctuation

- Always use the Oxford (serial) comma. 
- Always hyphenate compound adjectives, such as third-party software.
- Do not use contractions.

- Do not use & when you want to use and.
- Do not use quotations marks unless it is part of your code phrase or you are directly quoting someone.
