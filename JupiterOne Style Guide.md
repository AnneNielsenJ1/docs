# JupiterOne Style Guide

 

## General Guidelines

**Voice**: Use the second person to be more direct and personable. We want our customers to know we are speaking directly to them.

**Tense**: Always use the present tense when speaking about current features. Only use the future tense when referring to some that has not yet released and is coming in the future. 

**Internationalization**: Keep your content in plain English, avoid colloquialisms, and other jargon not recognized outside the US. Remember that not all customers will be native English speakers and we don't want to slow down their comprehension. 

Contractions and abbreviations: For plain English reasons, spell out contraction and avoid using abbreviations such as "e.g., etc.".



## Formatting

Use bold for all UI controls, such as buttons and tabs.

## Punctuation

Always use the Oxford (serial) comma.
