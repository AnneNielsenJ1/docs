2019-01-07

## New Features

- **Graph** mode for the search/query results in Landing Zone is now available!
  You can switch to Graph mode for any search or query to get a focused visual
  or the entities and relationships from the results. The graph is interactive
  so that you can further expand for deeper analysis.

- Much improved **Search in Landing Zone** that allows all of the following
  modes in one place:

  1. **Keywords search** to ask saved/packaged questions
  2. **Full text search** across all entities based on their property values
  3. **JupiterOne query language (J1QL)** for precise querying of entities and relationships
  4. **Combining** full text search with J1QL

- New ingestion and analysis from **AWS**:

  - S3 Bucket ACL processing and access mapping
  - S3 Bucket public access block configuration
  - Account password policy
  - IAM User MFA devices and access keys

- Added **OR** operator support on relationship keywords in **J1QL**. For example:
  `Find HostAgent that (PROTECTS|MANAGES|MONITORS) Host`

- Condensed **quick filter by entity class icons** in Asset Inventory app.

- You can **edit or delete** an entity manually from the Asset Inventory app.

- **Web links** are added to most entities ingested, allowing you to directly
  open in a new tab to view the resource in the source web console.

- Added linking to **Geolocation lookup of IP Address and CIDR** of a Host or
  Network.
