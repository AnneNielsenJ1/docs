- Added a GDPR standard/framework example within Compliance as an example users can reference to better understand 
  how to set up their own compliance framework/standard aligned with this EU privacy regulation.
  
## Integrations

### Jamf

- Added support for `extension_attributes` on the  `user_endpoint` 
  asset (Computer). An extension attribute appears as the property 
  `extensionAttribute.<id#>`, with a value equal to the array of 
  values of the JAMF extension attribute.

### JumpCloud

- Added support for ingesting the following new entity:

| Resources   | Entity `_type`          | Entity `_class` |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Application | `jumpcloud_application` | `Application`   |

- Added support for ingesting the following new relationships:

| Source Entity `_type` | Relationship `_class` | Target Entity `_type`  |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| `jumpcloud_account`   | HAS               | `jumpcloud_application` |
| `jumpcloud_user`      | ASSIGNED          | `jumpcloud_application` |
| `jumpcloud_group`     | ASSIGNED          | `jumpcloud_application` |

## Fixes and Resolutions
- MySecurity has been "deprecated". This beta feature will be removed from JupiterOne in December 2021. 
  In 2022 we expect to launch an improved version which will guide users on what actions they own and 
  need to take to improve their security posture.
