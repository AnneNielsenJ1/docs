# JupiterOne 2021.79 Release

September 8, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

- Update to the query language to follow De Morgan's Law.

  To maintain language correctness, J1QL fulfills shorthand filters in accordance 
  with De Morgan's Law. This improvement only impacts queries that use the 
  operators `!=`, `!~=`, `!^=`, `!$=` when operating on a group of values.

  For example, 

  ```j1ql
  FIND jira_user WITH accountType != ('atlassian' OR 'app' OR 'customer')
  ```

  is the equivalent of

  ```j1ql
  FIND jira_user WITH 
    accountType != 'atlassian' AND 
    accountType !=  'app' AND 
    accountType !=  'customer'
  ```

  Basically, J1QL interprets the above query to return all `jira_user` entities, 
  excluding those that have an `accountType` value of `atlassian` or `app` or `customer`. 

    !!! warning
      **This is a breaking change!** We are taking precautions to ensure saved questions 
      and queries are not inadvertently affected.  

      We are running maintenance jobs to update all saved queries in questions, 
      alerts, and Insights dashboard widgets during the rollout of this change.
      You do NOT have to make those changes manually.
      
      However, if you have stored queries outside of your JupiterOne account 
      (such as in a custom script), please update those queries accordingly.   

  

- Updated the JupiterOne query language to enable relationship direction with the use of double arrows,`<<` and `>>`.

- Added search functionality to the Groups page in the Users & Access menu.

- Improved the text wrapping in the query search window.

- Query Anywhere now auto-focuses when opened.

- Improved messaging when bulk synchronization fails.
