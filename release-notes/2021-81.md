## New Features and Improvements

- A refreshed landing page for querying your data. The updated search app also 
  includes an onboarding To-Do list for new J1 users to help them get oriented and obtain 
  value from their data.
- You can now perform bulk uploads of data in the UI without a file size limit.


## Fixes and Resolutions

- Resolved an issue where the overall compliant percentage was incorrectly 
  displaying as zero.
- Resolved an issue where logging out redirected a user to the incorrect URL.
- Fixed an issue with the J1 UI where a user session was terminated due 
  to inactivity and yet the UI did not refresh, delaying the response to the user.
- Fixed an issue in the Compliance app where the overall summary percentage 
  appeared to display 0%, even with multiple underlying compliance 
  frameworks toggled on with percentages > 0%.
