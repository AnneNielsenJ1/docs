# JupiterOne 2021.83 Release

November 3, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

- You can now see and review items in the Graph Viewer app that have *problems* 
  associated with them.
- The Center for Internet Security (CIS)) Controls Version 8 is released as a compliance 
  standard within the J1 Compliance app. Additionally, [the controls are mapped](../guides/compliance/compliance-mapping-policies.md) to 
  the default procedures within the Policies app.

## Integrations

You now have more control over when integration jobs run to avoid J1 using APIs 
and other resources when it impacts more mission-critical activities. The improvement 
allows you to set an hour of the day or day of the week, depending on which polling 
interval you select in the configuration. The new optional parameter, `pollingIntervalCronExpression`, is added to the [JupiterOne platform API](../docs/jupiterone-api.md). Currently,
you can only set this parameter by making an API call. This setting is not yet available
in the UI.

### AWS

- J1 is no longer adding  `aws_lambda_function.codeLocation` to assets as it does not
  provide any security insight value and only introduces a potential vulnerability and 
  unnecessary versioning.
- J1 is removing any AWS secret access keys from properties that are setting them when
  the integration runs. Current values are now overwritten with the latest values and 
  "REDACTED" appears in the place of the keys.

### Qualys

- The status filter for host detections is changed to explicitly request and ingest any New, Fixed, Active, and Re-Opened statuses. By default, Fixed detections are not returned from Qualys unless explicitly specified. This change allows you to view in the graph detections that are Fixed to track the movement of your detections of any status.

## Fixes and Resolutions

- The Graph Viewer widget in the Insights app now enables you to select a default layout,
  either mesh, horizontal tree, or vertical tree.
- When you go **Resources > Report an issue**, you can now upload screenshots, videos, and other files.
