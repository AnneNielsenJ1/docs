# JupiterOne 2021.83 Release

November 3, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

- Assets in the Graph Viewer that have a *problem* associated with them now have a visual indication and details of the problem 
  in the properties side panel. 
  
- The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls Version 8 is now available as a standard in the 
  Compliance app with [the mapped controls](../guides/compliance/compliance-mapping-policies.md) to the default procedures 
  within the Policies app.
  
- You can now set a default layout for the Insights Graph Viewer widget. You may select from 
  mesh, horizontal tree, or vertical tree.
  
- You can now upload screenshots, videos, or other files in **Resources > Report an issue**.

## Integrations

You can now schedule integration job runs for a specific hour of the day or day of the week - depending on your customized polling configuration. 
This prevents J1 from consuming resources around mission-critical activities. 
You can set the optional parameter, `pollingIntervalCronExpression`, via the [JupiterOne platform API](../docs/jupiterone-api.md). 
NOTE: This functionality is not supported in the UI

### AWS

- J1 is no longer adding  `aws_lambda_function.codeLocation` to assets as it does not
  provide any security insight value and only introduces a potential vulnerability and 
  unnecessary versioning.
  
- J1 is removing any AWS secret access keys from properties that are setting them when
  the integration runs. Current values are now overwritten with the latest values and 
  "REDACTED" appears in the place of the keys.

### Qualys

- The status filter for host detections has been changed to explicitly request and ingest any 'New', 'Fixed', 'Active', and 'Re-Opened' statuses. 
  By default, 'Fixed' detections are not returned from Qualys unless explicitly specified. This allows you to view in the graph detections that are 
  'Fixed' and to track the changes to detections of any status.
