# JupiterOne 2021.84 Release

November 2, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

- You can now see and review items in the Graph Viewer app that have *problems* 
  associated with them.
- 

## Integrations

- You now have more control over when integration jobs run to avoid J1 using APIs 
  and other resources  when it impacts more mission-critical activities. The improvement 
  allows you to set an hour of the day or day of the week, depending on which polling 
  interval you select in the configuration. The new optional parameter, `pollingIntervalCronExpression`, is added to the [JupiterOne platform API](../docs/jupiterone-api.md). Currently,
  you can only set this parameter by making an API call. This setting is not yet available
  in the UI.

## Fixes and Resolutions

- The Graph Viewer widget in the Insights app now enables you to select a default layout,
  either mesh, horizontal tree, or vertical tree.
- The "Report an issue" now allows you to upload screenshots, videos, and other files
