# JupiterOne 2020.49 Release

2020-07-14

## New Features

- Added support for **Draft - Review/Approval - Publish** workflow to managing
  policy / procedure documents in the **Policies** app.

- New **Finding Details view** and **Owners/Maintainers view** for for each
  vulnerability finding or alert finding.

- New **Audit Tracking** feature for compliance. 

  When enabled, compliance admins / auditors can manage and change the audit
  status for each requirement via the status drop down in the requirement
  details view (similar to the workflow when managing a Jira issue). This also
  adds an indicator to each requirement row in the compliance standard
  dashboard.

  > via the Asset Inventory UI. More system alerts/notifications such as
  > integration execution errors will be added soon.

  - Only Admins can edit insights widgets
