# JupiterOne 2018.14 Release

2018-12-18

## New Features

- Lots of features added to JupiterOne Query Language (J1QL)

  - Query now supports **aggregations**

    _Example:_ `FIND User as u return COUNT(u)` to get a count of all users

  - Query now supports **date comparison**

    _Example:_ `FIND * with _updatedOn > date.now-24hrs` to find all resources
    that changed in the last 24 hours.

  - Query now supports **simplified selection of multiple entities** (`OR`)

    _Example_: `Find Host|Device with ipAddress='10.50.2.17'` is equivalent to
    `Find * with _class='Host' or _class='Device' with ipAddress='10.50.2.17'`

- You can now manually **add entities** via the Asset Inventory app

- You can see **detailed properties in a side panel** by selecting an entity in
  the Asset Inventory app

- New **Users and Access**, **My Profile** and **Invitations** experience

- JupiterOne now ingests **AWS networking** data and maps out detailed
  relationships to enable deep analysis of network traffic access permissions.
  This allows security teams to gain accurate insight into which host(s) or
  network(s) are truly accessible from an external network or host (e.g. the
  Internet).

- JupiterOne now analysis **AWS assume role** policy to determine trust
  relationships between an IAM role and a service or another IAM principal
  either within the same account or from an external account.

- Users can now sign on to JupiterOne via **Google Sign On**.

## Improvements

- Improvements on relationship mapping:

  - Support mapping to multiple targets from an array of source property values
  - Support mapping from multiple source properties to a single target property
  - Allow an integration to create target mapped entity from a relationship
  - Trigger mapper to run when `mappings.json` configuration changes

- Added lots of documentation on data model, details of data ingestion from
  integrations, and data security.

- Fixed “encrypted” property showing up as “undefined” for some AWS entities

- Added AWS S3 region and improved encryption properties 
  
  e.g. _you can find data stores outside of EU with a query like_
  `FIND DataStore with region != 'eu-central-1'`
  
- A few other small bug fixes and UI improvements
