  The alert above is configured with the following `slackBody` template and
  action:

    ```json
    "templates": {
      "slackBody": "Function Name: {{item.functionName}}\nMemory size: {{item.memorySize}}\n\n"
    },
    ...
    "operations": [
      {
        ...
        "actions": [
          ...
          {
            "type": "SEND_SLACK_MESSAGE",
            "body": "{{queries.query0.data|mapTemplate('slackBody')|join(' ')}}",
            "webhookUrl": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/ABC/DEF"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

  Additionally, `{{alertWebLink}}` is available as a variable that can be
  referenced in rule templating.
