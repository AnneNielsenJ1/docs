# JupiterOne 2021.86 Release

December 15, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

- Account administrators can now create account-scope API tokens which ties the token to organization account 
  rather than an individual user account. 
  
- Account administrations can now parameterize sensitive values such as secrets for use in J1QL queries and '
  questions without exposing them.

## Integrations

### AWS

J1 has updated AWS S3 bucket access data to better align with AWS S3 bucket access presented in the AWS console. 
You may see a change to some access settings data next time you use the J1 AWS integration. 

JupiterOne presents:
 
  AWS `Access Public` aligns with J1 `public: true`

  AWS `Access Objects can be public` aligns with J1 `public: undefined`

  AWS `Access Bucket and objects not public` aligns with J1 `public: false`

This update significantly improves the understanding of your bucket access settings in comparison to the previous 
reliance on [get-bucket-policy-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-policy-status.html). 

If you notice inconsistencies in your data, let J1 know so that we can further tune and improve our logic. 

## Fixes and Resolutions

- MySecurity has been removed from JupiterOne. In 2022, we expect to launch an improved version to guide you on 
  which actions you own and need to take to improve your security posture.
