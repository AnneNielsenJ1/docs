# JupiterOne 2021.86 Release

## Integrations

### AWS

J1 has updated AWS S3 bucket access data to better align with AWS S3 bucket access presented in the AWS console. 
You may see a change to some access settings data next time you use the J1 AWS integration. 

JupiterOne presents:
 
  AWS `Access Public` aligns with J1 `public: true`

  AWS `Access Objects can be public` aligns with J1 `public: undefined`

  AWS `Access Bucket and objects not public` aligns with J1 `public: false`

This update significantly improves the understanding of your bucket access settings in comparison to the previous 
reliance on [get-bucket-policy-status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-policy-status.html). 

If you notice inconsistencies in your data, let J1 know so that we can further tune and improve our logic.
