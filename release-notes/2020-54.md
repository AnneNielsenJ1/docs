  ```

- Fixed an issue where deleted entities were showing up in all queries and were also not formatted correctly

- Markdown can now render markdown inside of admonitions in the policies app

- Fixed an issue causing insights to load with the wrong url

- Fixed an issue where insights board would be loaded without a layout

- Added failed request retry logic so all parts of the app should hopefully be a bit more resilient now
