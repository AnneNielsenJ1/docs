# JupiterOne 2021.78 Release

August 24, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

- The query policy editor in the Account Settings page is improved to now work with the updated APIs as expected.
- The Relationship Count is removed from the legend in the Account Usage graph

## Integrations

### AWS

- Fixed error processing for GuardDuty findings.

### GitHub

- Added support for ingesting the following **new** entities:

| Entity                      |
| --------------------------- |
| github_app\*                |
| github_user (role: OUTSIDE) |

\* This usage requires that an GitHub organization admin allows the `organization_administration: read` scope for the JupiterOne GitHub app. Github notifies admins by email.



- Added support for ingesting the following **new** relationships:

| Source         | Class     | Target                      |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| github_account | INSTALLED | github_app                  |
| github_repo    | ALLOWS    | github_user (role: OUTSIDE) |

### Google Cloud

- Added managed question: 
  "Which Google Cloud API services are disabled for my project?"

- Changed `google_iam_bindings.permissions: string[]` to
  `google_iam_bindings.permissions: string` due to limitations on
  `string[]`property lengths in JupiterOne. Queries need to change from `permissionmks={{string}}` to `permissions~={{string}}` to maintain expected query results.

- Managed `google_iam_roles` now have a `permissions` property, similar to
  custom `google_iam_roles`.

- Allowed BigQuery data to be ingested independently of KMS key data.

### Jira

- Loosened hostname validation to allow `example.atlassian.net/jira`.

- Fixed the error that occurs when a issue creator or reporter user is no longer in the Jira instance.

- Migrated to the latest SDK. Let us know if you observe any problems.

### KnowBe4

- Fixed failure to handle repeated entries for training modules.
- Fixed failure to handle invalid users or modules listed in enrollments.
- Fixed logging to correctly report fetch errors.
- Fixed handling non-rate-limiting errors to avoid invoking backoff-retry function.

## Bug Fixes

- Resolved an issue where paginating query results in a compliance requirement provided unexpected results.

- Improved the policies app so that the *No procedure found* image was not shown while the app was loading.
- Resolved an issue where users were unable to delete a policy or procedure with an invalid template.
- Resolved an issue where `accessRule` permission errors were displayed when querying under certain circumstances.
- Resolved an issue where questions with multiple queries would not paginate.

## Coming Soon!

### Update to Query Language to follow De Morgan's Law

To maintain language correctness, J1QL will fulfill shorthand filters in accordance 
with De Morgan's Law. This improvement only impacts queries that use the 
operators `!=`, `!~=`, `!^=`, `!$=` when operating on a group of values.

For example, 

```j1ql
FIND jira_user WITH accountType != ('atlassian' OR 'app' OR 'customer')
```

is the equivalent of

```j1ql
FIND jira_user WITH 
  accountType != 'atlassian' AND 
  accountType !=  'app' AND 
  accountType !=  'customer'
```

Basically, J1QL interprets the above query to return all `jira_user` entities, 
excluding those that have an `accountType` value of `atlassian` or `app` or `customer`. 

!!! warning
**This is a breaking change!** We are taking precautions to ensure saved questions 
and queries are not inadvertently affected.  

```
We are running maintenance jobs to update all saved queries in questions, 
alerts, and Insights dashboard widgets during the rollout of this change.
You do _not_ have to make those changes manually.

However, if you have stored queries outside of your JupiterOne account 
(such as in a custom script), please update those queries accordingly. 
```

!!! note
    This change is planned to release on **Tuesday, Aug 31, 2021**.
