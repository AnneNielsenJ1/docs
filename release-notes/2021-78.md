# JupiterOne 2021.78 Release

August 24, 2021

## New Features and Improvements

### Update to Query Language to follow De Morgan's Law

To maintain language correctness, J1QL will fulfill shorthand filters in accordance 
with De Morgan's Law. This improvement only impacts queries that use the 
operators `!=`, `!~=`, `!^=`, `!$=` when operating on a group of values.

For example, 

```j1ql
FIND jira_user WITH accountType != ('atlassian' OR 'app' OR 'customer')
```

is the equivalent of

```j1ql
FIND jira_user WITH 
  accountType != 'atlassian' AND 
  accountType !=  'app' AND 
  accountType !=  'customer'
```

Basically, J1QL interprets the above query to return all `jira_user` entities, 
excluding those that have an `accountType` value of `atlassian` or `app` or `customer`. 

!!! warning
**This is a breaking change!** We are taking precautions to ensure saved questions 
and queries are not inadvertently affected. 
    

```
We are running maintenance jobs to update all saved queries in questions, 
alerts, and Insights dashboard widgets during the rollout of this change.
You do _not_ have to make those changes manually.

However, if you have stored queries outside of your JupiterOne account 
(such as in a custom script), please update those queries accordingly.
