``Record``
==========

An official record (e.g. Risk), or a written document (e.g. Policy/Procedure), or a reference entity (e.g. Vulnerability/Weakness). This could be a jira-issue, a bitbucket-pull-request, a jenkins-build, a policy document, a vulnerability finding, a documented risk, or even a paper-record. The exact record type is captured in the _type property of the Entity.

Includes properties from:

* `RecordEntity <RecordEntity.html>`_
* `Metadata <Metadata.html>`_
